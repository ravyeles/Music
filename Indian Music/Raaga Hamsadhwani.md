# Rāga Hamsadhwani

A carnatical Raga, Hamsadhwani literally translates to "Cry of the Swan", was devised by [Ramasami Dikshitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramaswami_Dikshitar) in 1776.
Comprising 5 of the seven notes, it's classified as an audava (pentatonic) raga, and the straightforward structure of it's ārohaṇa and it's avarohaṇa make this raga a delight to explore and elaborate in.

In another case of apocryphal legends colliding, swans have had their place in both Greek and Vedic tales. Swansong might be common tongue these days for a heroic performance usually preceeding a retiral, but in an early Aesop's fable ["The Swan and the Goose"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swan_and_the_Goose), the swan's song actually saves it's life (no deaths for those looking for some cheap thrills). The Greeks also considered the swans to stand for harmony and beauty. 

In other apocryphal legends,
> [Hamsa is a swan like mythical bird, inhabiting the Manasa lake in the Himalayan heights and regarded as a celestial being, symbolizing purity, freedom, wisdom, and salvation.](https://icmacy.org/what-is-icm-raag-hamsadhwani/)

With all these odds stacked in it's favor it's no suprise, hamsadhwani comes across as a bright, peaceful, melodious raga that can be turned up to bring out some energy as well.
