# Rāga Hamsadhwani

A carnatical Raga, Hamsadhwani literally translates to "Cry of the Swan", was devised by [Ramasami Dikshitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramaswami_Dikshitar) in 1776.
Comprising 5 of the seven notes, it's classified as an audava (pentatonic) raga, and the straightforward structure of it's ārohaṇa and it's avarohaṇa make this raga a delight to explore and elaborate in.
